# Data Repository for **Keratins coordinate tissue spreading by balancing spreading forces with tissue material properties** Naik et al. (2026)
## Description
This repository contains the data analysis notebooks and scripts used to generate figures for the Naik et al. 2026 manuscript (Heisenberg Lab). It is aimed to organize to keep raw/derived data in addition to the notebooks that plot the figure panels and reusable scripts, so figure panels used in the manuscript can be reproduced consistently. THis repo is mainly maintained by me, Dr. Suyash Naik. In case of any questions please reach out to me by email provided below. The vertex model accompanying this paper and its associated data was generated by Dr. Yann Edwin-Keta and Dr. Silke Henkes. 

### Manuscript Abstract

For tissues to spread, they must deform while staying intact. How spreading tissues balance flexibility with integrity is not yet well understood. Here, we show that keratin intermediate filaments adapt tissue mechanical resilience to the stresses arising in epithelial tissues during spreading. By analysing the expansion of the enveloping cell layer (EVL) over the yolk cell in zebrafish embryos in vivo, we find that keratin network maturation in EVL cells is promoted by stresses building up within the spreading tissue. Through genetic interference and tissue rheology experiments, complemented by a vertex model with mechanochemical feedback, we demonstrate that stress-induced keratin network maturation in the EVL increases tissue viscosity, to prevent tissue rupture. Further, keratins are required in the yolk cell for mechanosensitive actomyosin network contraction and flow, the forces pulling the EVL. These dual mechanosensitive functions of keratins enable a balance between pulling force production and EVL mechanical resilience, ensuring uniform and robust tissue spreading.

## Usage 

The notebooks are designed to be used with pixi to manage the environment and run Jupyter notebooks.

1. Install the environment (first time only): ```pixi install```

2. Start JupyterLab from the project root: ```pixi run jupyter lab```

    - or Use the `jupserve` task to run JupyterLab without a browser and bind to all interfaces: ``` pixi run jupserve```

    - or Use the pipette aspiration analyssis script by using: ``` pixi run python src/Spanselection_pipette.py```

3. Open any .ipynb file and run cells from there to recreate each panel for the figures.


## Style guide

The figures and plots use the following style elements which you would need to have on your system. These colors are kept standard and are colorblind friendly! 
- **Fonts**: Helvetica and Arial
- **Color scheme** hex ids:
    - Main color: #83BB03
    - Other green: #27BB03
    - Brown (depreciated): #BB9703
    - Orange : #ff7f0e
    - Blue: '#0383bb'
    - Ruby pink: '#bb0383'
